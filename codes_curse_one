Find the difference between the average rating of movies released before 1980 and the average rating of movies released after 1980. (Make sure to calculate the average rating for each movie, then the average of those averages for movies before 1980 and movies after. Don't just calculate the overall average rating before and after 1980.)

SELECT
    COALESCE(AVG(CASE WHEN year < 1980 THEN avg1 END), 0)
       - COALESCE(AVG(CASE WHEN year >= 1980 THEN avg1 END), 0) rating_diff
FROM (
    SELECT m.mID, m.year, AVG(stars * 1.0) avg1
    FROM Movie m
    INNER JOIN Rating r ON m.mID = r.mID
    GROUP BY m.mID, m.year
) x
